https://github.com/om-ai-lab/VLM-R1
and then go inside the base directory and add the run_grpo_main.sh script from this folder.
you should then go inside src/open-r1-multimodal/src/open_r1/vlm_modules/qwen_module.py and replace the qwen module with the one from this folder.
Then you can run the run_grpo_main.sh script.
