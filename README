In order to run the training script for grpo you first need to download the VLM-R1 project from:
https://github.com/om-ai-lab/VLM-R1
and then go inside the base directory and add the run_grpo_main.sh script from this folder.
you should then go inside src/open-r1-multimodal/src/open_r1/vlm_modules/qwen_module.py and replace the qwen module with the one from this folder.
Then you can run the run_grpo_main.sh script.

Iteration 1 runs inference in the notebook.
Iteration 2 uses LLamaFactory to run the training and inference for SFT.

Paste the contents of qwen_data into the ARTA_LEGO folder after downloading it using the notebook.
Use the generated data to run the training script using LLamaFactory. The generated data is interchangable with both the SFT and GRPO training scripts.
